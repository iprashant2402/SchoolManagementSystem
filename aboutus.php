        <p class="lead">Jyotsana Public School came into existence with a clear vision of creating a complete environment & balance in between society and children by retaining their moral values and better opportunities.</p>
        <p class="lead">Education of a child should be the joint effort in school. So it is very necessary to make a balance between them. Now a day parents don’t have quality time for their children. but for their complete development it is good for your child that you spend some time with your ward and supervise his/her homework and told him about personal cleanliness and our moral values. I welcome all the staff members, students and our parents joining JPHSS family for this session.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Our philosophy of education has always been meeting the needs of the individual child.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We all are concerned with children as they have lives beyond the classroom, and we can not meet their needs if we show no concern for their activities outside school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a great pleasure in inviting you and your children to be a part of learning beyond boundaries and be a part of the spirit of global learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a wise man said, “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire!” We look forward to lighting the fire in our children that leads them on to wisdom and turn for the greater good of humankind.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Offering education of standard, championed by the motto of, “Service Before Sell” which is a vivid reflection of the mettle that goes into making of an Institution.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m immensely gratified that the school has evolved as a paragon of the comprehensive educational institution of the new century by fusing together scholastic & non- scholastic domains. The school has been on a fast growth trajectory.</p>
